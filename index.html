							<p> Last November 30, Ariana Grande released her latest single's
							music video. Ariana Grande’s “thank u, next” is one such music video,
							becoming one of the most impactful viral events in YouTube’s 
							history. Shortly after its premiere on Friday afternoon, it 
							broke the record for most Vevo views (55.4 million) in 24 hours, 
							surpassing BTS' "Idol" and Taylor Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do.” 
							Three days later, it broke another record for the fastest time to reach 
							100 million views, surpassing Adele’s “Hello.” It even led to a spike in 
							Amazon Prime streams of the movies (Mean Girls, Bring It On, Legally Blonde, 
							13 Going On 30) that “thank u, next” paid homage to. <p/>

				<h1> DUMBO </h1>
				<h3> Flying March 29, 2019 </h3>
				<img src="images/dumbo.png" width="200" height="300">
				<p> “Dumbo” still has a ways to go before its cleared for take off, 
				but at least now we know the final destination. Disney has confirmed 
				Tim Burton’s live-action adaptation of the 1941 animated classic 
				will fly into theaters March 29, 2019. 
				<br>
				<br>
				“Dumbo” was just one of Disney’s many attractions at the D23 Expo on Saturday. 
				While Burton was not presentat the convention, the director did send in a video message from inside the
				real life train-car utilized in the original film. He used the clip to confirm
				that production has officially begun on his reimagining of the high-flying 
				elephant adventure. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Colin Farrell, Eva Green, Danny DeVito, 
				and Michael Keaton are now confirmed to star opposite newcomers Nico 
				Parker and Finley Hobbins in their first film roles. Roshan Seth, DeObia Oparei, 
				Sharon Rooney, and Douglas Reith also star. Will Smith was circling the lead role
				in “Dumbo,” but walked away from a deal due to scheduling conflicts. He has since 
				been cast as Genie in Guy Ritchie’s live-action version of “Aladdin.”
				<br>
				<br>
				Plans of a live-action Dumbo remake were announced in 2014 and Burton was confirmed 
				as director in March 2015. Much of the cast signed on in March 2017 and 
				principal photography began in July of that year in the United Kingdom, 
				lasting until November. It will be released in Real D 3D, IMAX, IMAX 3D and Dolby Cinema.

				<h1> The Princess Switch </h1>
				<img src="images/switch.png" width="300" height="200">
				<p>  The Princess Switch will star Vanessa Hudgens and British actor Sam Palladio. 
				As you could probably guess, it will come out this winter on Netflix, according to Hudgens' 
				Instagram post about the movie. Hudgens announced the film on social media, calling it "The Christmas Switch."
				However, on Netflix's See What's Next Twitter account, the site announced the movie with the title 
				The Princess Switch. A representative for Netflix confirmed to Bustle that the title is, indeed, 
				The Princess Switch. The official movie title doesn't have anything to do with the 
				Holiday season, but given that Hudgens mistook the name for "The Christmas Switch," 
				it seems safe to say fans are looking at a new Netflix Christmas movie, following in 
				the footsteps of last year's instant cult-favorite, A Christmas Prince. As Buzzfeed points out,
				Netflix also has a sequel to A Christmas Prince coming out later this year, called A Christmas 
				Prince: The Royal Wedding </p>

				<h1> #COMEBACKONEDIRECTION TRENDS AFTER LIAM PAYNE HINTS AT CHRISTMAS REUNION! </h1>
				<p> Fans are trying to save themselves from another One Direction-less Christmas 
				trending #ComeBackOneDirection on Twitter! Will we finally have ourselves a merry little Christmas,
				fellow Directioners? 
				<br>
				<br>
				The hope is rising once again after Liam Payne casually mentioned a potential get 
				together over the holidays since Niall Horan, Harry Styles, and Louis Tomlinson will also be in the UK.
				“I hope to see them over Christmas but we are so busy and tired, it is what it is," he told Capital FM. 
				"I saw Louis over the course of X Factor but I haven’t seen Harry in a while. I think this is the first 
				time we’ve all been in London at the same time so it’s the closest we’ve been as a band for a while, 
				so why not?” YES. WHY NOT, RIGHT?
				<br>
				<br>
				All we want for Christmas is a 1D reunion - in any form possible.</p>
